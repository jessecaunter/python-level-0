# Basic Python Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple Python programs I've written to help me learn the language:

## 1. Hello World
A slight variation on the classic "Hello World" program.

## 2. Username generator
Takes the hard-coded first and last names, then uses string indexing, slicing, and concatenation to create and print a username.
