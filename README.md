# Basic Python Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple Python programs I've written to help me learn the language:

## 1. Hello World
A slight variation on the classic "Hello World" program.

## 2. Username generator
Takes the hard-coded first and last names, then uses string indexing, slicing, and concatenation to create and print a username.

## 3. Fantasy matchup result
Takes two hard-coded scores: one representing how many categories you won, and the other representing how many categories your opponent won. An if-elif-else statement is then run to determine whether the result was a win, loss, or draw.

## 4. Calculate an average
Asks user to specify how many numbers they'd like to calculate the average of. A for loop then runs however many times the user specified, each time prompting them to enter an integer. Once all numbers have been entered, the average is calculated and printed on screen.

## 5. Running score tally
Keeps a running score - perfect when we don't know how many integers will be input in advance. Only positive integers may be added. As soon as a negative integer is input, the program prints out the final score before exiting.

## 6. Personal message
Store a person's name in a variable, and print a message to that person.

## 7. Name cases
Store a person's name in a variable, and then print that person's name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

## 8. Famous quote
Print a famous quote, along with the name of the person who said it.

## 9. Stripping names
Store a person's name which includes some whitespace characters at the beginning and end.
Print name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

## 10. Number eight
Four different operations that result in the number 8.

## 11. Favourite number
Store your favourite number in variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favourite number.
Print that message.

## 12. Names
Store the names of a few friends in a list. Print each person's name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

## 13. Greetings
Print a personalised message to each person in a list of names.

## 14. Nuggets players list
Prints a personalised message about each of the starters.

## 15. Changing guest list
Prints a message to each person in a list, inviting them for dinner. One of the people in the guest list can't make it, so they are replaced with someone else. A second set of invitation messages is then printed.

## 16. More guests
Prints a message to each person in a list, inviting them for dinner. Three more guests added to the list via insert() and append() methods. A second set of invitation messages is then printed.

## 17. Shrinking guest list
Starts with code from previous program, but then a number of people are removed from the list using pop() and del.
