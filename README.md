# Basic Python Programs

This repository contains a collection of simple Python programs I've written to help me learn the language:

## 1. Hello World
A slight variation on the classic "Hello World" program.

## 2. Username generator
Takes the hard-coded first and last names, then uses string indexing, slicing, and concatenation to create and print a username.

## 3. Fantasy matchup result
Takes two hard-coded scores: one representing how many categories you won, and the other representing how many categories your opponent won. An if-elif-else statement is then run to determine whether the result was a win, loss, or draw.

## 4. Calculate an average
Asks user to specify how many numbers they'd like to calculate the average of. A for loop then runs however many times the user specified, each time prompting them to enter an integer. Once all numbers have been entered, the average is calculated and printed on screen.

## 5. Running score tally
Keeps a running score - perfect when we don't know how many integers will be input in advance. Only positive integers may be added. As soon as a negative integer is input, the program prints out the final score before exiting.

## 6. Personal message
Store a person's name in a variable, and print a message to that person.

## 7. Name cases
Store a person's name in a variable, and then print that person's name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.
